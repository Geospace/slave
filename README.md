# Slave

Minimalistic but yet powerful prompt for fish shell.

Slave is a fork of [Boss](https://github.com/fisherman/boss). It is not
maintained anymore, I switched to [Starship](https://starship.rs/).

## Installation

You can install Slave with [Fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman).
Simply copy and paste the following lines in your terminal :

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/Geospace/slave.git
cd slave
fisher install . --link
echo "Done !"
```

Slave is just a bunch of fish prompt functions so it can also be installed
manually.
