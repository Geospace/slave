# Slave

Minimalistic but yet powerful prompt for fish shell.

Slave is a fork of [Boss](https://github.com/fisherman/boss), with more
features. New features include :

  * Tmux session indicator
  * More accurate git tracking
  * Vi mode tracking
  * Colorful environment

Slave is really light and shows informations only when you **need** to see
them. Slave should be able to run on any font or color configuration.
