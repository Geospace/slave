# Slave

Minimalistic but yet powerful prompt for fish shell.

Slave is a fork of [Boss](https://github.com/fisherman/boss), with more
features. New features include :

  * Tmux session indicator
  * More accurate git tracking
  * Vi mode tracking
  * Colorful environment

Slave is really light and shows informations only when you **need** to see
them. Slave should be able to run on any font or color configuration.

## Installation

You can install Slave with [Fisherman](https://github.com/fisherman/fisherman).
Simply copy and paste the following lines in your terminal :

``` terminal
git clone https://github.com/Geospace/slave.git
cd slave
fisher install . --link
echo "Done !"
```

Slave is just a bunch of fish prompt functions so it can also be installed
manually.
